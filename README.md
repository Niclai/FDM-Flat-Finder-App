# FDM-Flat-Finder-App

## Project Description: 
This website was developed to allow FDM consultants to advertise there properties to rent, and also allow them to look for properties. 

How this process works is by consultants having there own profiles. This give each property listed an owner and all rent applications can be linked back to a consultant.
All the listings are externally saved and fetched from a ***mongo Database***. This ensures real time updates to the data being displayed on the website.

### Features: 
- WatchList page specific to consultants
- Real time data fetching
- Rent application Forms/Submit a property for listing form
- Login system for consultants

## Technologies used:
React, Javascript, CSS, BootStrap, Python 

## How to run: 
To run this application you would have to change directory into the ***server*** file and run the file "server.py" 'python3 server.py' Whilst this file is running you are now able to run the ***client*** folder by using 'npm start'

As a consultants credentials must be entered to log into the websites home page, if you do not have the login credentials you are greeted with a log in page and this is the furthest you can go. If you have access to credentials then you are able to log in and access the full website.
