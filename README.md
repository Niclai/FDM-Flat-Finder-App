# FDM-Flat-Finder-App

## Project Description: 
This website was developed to allow FDM consultants to advertise there properties to rent, and also allow them to look for properties. 

How this process works is by consultants having there own profiles. This give each property listed an owner and all rent applications can be linked back to a consultant.
All the listings are externally saved and fetched from a ***mongo Database***. This ensures real time updates to the data being displayed on the website.
